# christmas-cards
Collection of Christmas cards designed over the years. Explore a collection of Christmas cards meticulously crafted over the years, each one bearing a unique design. Originating during my tenure on the board for CASE (Chalmers Autonomous System and Electronics), these cards have evolved into a personal tradition. Featuring Christmas-themed printed circuit boards (PCBs) adorned with special functionalities, such as blinking LEDs and questionable buzzer music. Most of these cards have been designed and assembled together with my close friends, @adaand00 and @johanwheeler. These cards are the result of stupid ideas combined with our shared interest of tinkering and electronics.
