# christmas-cards
Collection of Christmas cards designed over the years. Explore a collection of Christmas cards meticulously crafted over the years, each one bearing a unique design. Originating during our time on the board for CASE (Chalmers Autonomous System and Electronics), these cards have evolved into a personal tradition. Featuring Christmas-themed printed circuit boards (PCBs) adorned with special functionalities, such as blinking LEDs and questionable buzzer music. The contributors usually consist of @Muoshy as project lead and in charge of the electrical design. @adaand00 has managed the software and graphical design aspects, while @johanwheeler has handled the mechanical design and assembly.
